			<p>First, Second, and Third Place finishes for the Governor's High School Cyber Challenge go to Canton High School! In order for these students to accomplish such a tremendous feat, they had to beat over 200 different schools aroundt the state of Michigan.

			According to Mr. Obsniuk: "Honestly, all I do is sign them up, give them the rules and tell them what to expect and they go from there. It's so early on in the school year, we don't have a lot of time to cover a whole lot of content or practice for the competition, so it's really a compilation of what they've learned throughout different computer science courses."

		<p class = "inner-text">When asked about some of the best tips for winning these challenges, these group members had very unique opinions: <br/> <br/> According to David Reeves: "You have to get into the hackers' minds, know what they're trying to do before you can prevent hacking. Every feature of a computer can be abused, so you have to be on the look out for suspicious-looking codes or red flags." <br/><br/> Eric D'Urso also adds, "The most important thing people need to remember is to not put themselves in compromising positions."</p>
